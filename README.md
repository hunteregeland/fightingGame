# CPP Combat!

This was the final project of my object-oriented programming course, CST-210, where we needed to design and implement a fantasy fighting game with file i/o, user tracking and saving, and other object-oriented programming concepts

If you'd like to run this game, run the main.cpp file in a C++ compiler with all header files and text files.

If you enter the game and want to load a current user, you can use either 'hunter' or 'riley' which are already created users.

Enjoy!
